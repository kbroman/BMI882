title: Biomedical data science scholarly literature
description: A seminar on scientific papers
---

Critical evaluation of the scholarly literature is a crucial skill for
researchers. Through this course (a continuation of [BMI
881](https://kbroman.org/BMI881)), Ph.D. students in Biomedical Data Science will develop this
valuable skill by focused reading and discussion of a variety of
journal articles of present or historical importance the biomedical
sciences literature, including biostatistics, biomedical informatics,
and relevant topics in statistics and computer science. Students will
read and discuss one article or a small group of related articles each
week. Students will provide short written summaries in advance of
discussion. In addition to the readings and discussion,
there will be three written homework assignments
related to the articles under discussion. These homework assignments
will involve an effort to reproduce the results of an article, the use
of computer simulation to investigate properties of methods discussed
in an article, or application of the discussed methods to related
biomedical data.
