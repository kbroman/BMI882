**[COVID-19](https://covid19.wisc.edu)**: Starting 24 March, and through the rest of the semester,
discussions and office hours will be strictly online.

### Discussions

For discussions, we will use [BBCollaborate
Ultra](https://it.wisc.edu/services/web-conferencing/) accessible via
the [course Canvas site](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/190668).
You should just need a web browser. They recommend Chrome, though
Firefox seems to work just fine for me. (Also, Safari on my iPad seems
to work well.)

We will meet at the usual time (Tues/Thurs 8:30-9:20 CDT).

To get to the online discussion, go to the
[course Canvas site](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/190668) and click
"BBCollaborate Ultra" on the left. We'll be using the general
"Course Room". You can also use the [guest
url](https://bit.ly/bb882_sp2020), <https://bit.ly/bb882_sp2020>.

There's also an option to join by phone. But I think each student
needs to get a unique PIN, so go to the [course Canvas
site](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/190668) to get the call-in
number and your PIN.

I will make everyone a presenter, so you should have control
over sharing materials and writing on the white board.

The [BBCollaborate course room](https://bit.ly/bb882_sp2020)
is open all the time, if you want to test out your audio/video in advance.


### Office hours

I also plan to hold office hours using [BBCollaborate
Ultra](https://it.wisc.edu/services/web-conferencing/).
Go to <https://bit.ly/offhrs_sp2020>.

You can also join the office hours by phone, but again I think each
student needs to get a unique PIN, so go to the [BBCollaborate
session](https://bit.ly/offhrs_sp2020) to get the call-in number and
your PIN.

I will be available there Tuesdays 9:30-10:30 and Fridays 10:30-11:30,
starting 24 March.

If you would like to get ahold of me at a different time or using a
different method, let me know by email.
